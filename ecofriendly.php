          MARKA, founded by a generation X'er and avid surfer naturally had to be environmentally conscious.  We can't imagine a company today that would disregard the environment, but the reality it that there are many.  In order to keep the planet in our minds, we believe two things need to happen, 1) You must believe this is good for you and your family, and for this we need some education on the topic  2)  You must have a economically stable company – once a company has money issues, one of the first things that get disregarded is a environmental management program.</p>

          <p class="quality">At Marka we are continually taking steps in being a cleaner and environmentally safe company.  We only use 100% vegetable based ink, and have a solid recycling program.  We spend thousands of dollars every year, sending our inks to and other raw materials to an external lab to confirm they are free from any prohibited materials.  We also have company community service programs, where we participate in the cleaning of our beaches and other nature areas.</p>
